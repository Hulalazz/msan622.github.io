<p>An <a href="{{ site.url }}/resources/workflow">Advanced Homework Workflow</a> guide has been posted using <a href="http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/">SourceTree</a>. This guide is only for advanced users unafraid of revision control, and not necessary to submit homework in this class. In particular, it allows you to update your homework repository anytime I update a homework description in the master repository.</p>
