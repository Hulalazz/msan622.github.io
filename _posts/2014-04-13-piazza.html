<p>We will start using <a href="https://usfca.instructure.com/courses/1217225/external_tools/63922">Piazza</a> for all homework questions in this class. This will provide a forum for people to see the responses to common questions, and share various tips and hints when it comes to wrangling <code>R</code>, <code>ggplot2</code>, and <code>shiny</code>.</p>

<p>I will start redirecting any questions sent via email to Piazza instead. You can post anonymously if you feel uncomfortable attaching your name to a question, or privately if you feel uncomfortable sharing your code. (Please note the instructor can always see who posts on Piazza, but other students will not see your name if you post anonymously.)</p>
