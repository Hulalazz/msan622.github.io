<p>Some students have expressed interest in learning D3 instead of R and ggplot2. Since we have a mix of backgrounds this semester, we will stick to R and ggplot2 as the primary tool.</p>

<p>If you want to self-learn D3, you will be able to submit homework and projects using D3 instead. No instruction will be given in D3, however.</p>
