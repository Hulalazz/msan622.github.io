<p>You can now see your homework 1 grades (and comments) in <a href="https://usfca.instructure.com/courses/1217225/assignments/4714992">Canvas</a>. I was lenient grading this homework. This goal of this homework was to get your GitHub repositories setup correctly and get you started in <code>ggplot2</code>. This will not be the case for future homework!</p>

<p>Please keep in mind the following for your future submissions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Please do not have <code>setwd()</code> in your R scripts. This will prevent me from being able to run your code directly from within R. You can use <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/using/projects">Projects in RStudio</a> to manage your working directories instead.</p></li>

<li><p>If you do not have enough to write about in your discussion, then you have not customized your visualization enough. Please include <em>what</em> you changed and <em>why</em> you made those changes. You can also discuss what you tried that did not work, and what you learned about the dataset from your visualization.</p></li>

<li><p>Please place your discussion in <code>README.md</code> since this is the file that automatically displays when I visit your repository. Also, consider using <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics">headings in README.md</a> to separate your discussion. This will make it easy to match your discussion to its associated plot.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Overall, I am thrilled to see so many of you trying out different things in <code>ggplot2</code>. I look forward to your future submissions.</p>

<p>Now, for the bad news. I may not always be able to look at everyone's homework submission directly. In that case, I will <a href="https://www.random.org/lists/">randomly select</a> students to grade. Everyone else will receive a 100%. Students that do not have a homework graded are guaranteed to have the next one graded. If you did not get your homework graded and want feedback, feel free to ask me for feedback after class on Thursdays.</p>
