<p>I released the grades for homework 2 in Canvas and unlocked the assignment so that you can view the rubric used. I really enjoyed seeing the creativity of everyone with the customizations. There were some really neat visualizations!</p>

<p>To select which students would have homework 2 graded, I randomized the list of all students using <a href="https://www.random.org/lists/">https://www.random.org/lists/</a> and selected the top half of the list. If you received a 0 on this assignment, this means you will have homework 3 graded instead. Note that Canvas is now setup to drop the lowest grade in the homework category.</p>

<p>I will repeat this process to determine who will have homework 4 versus homework 5 graded, but will not release the randomization until after homework 5 has been submitted.</p>
