<p>I will hold <strong>bonus office hours</strong> this week on Tuesday 05/06 and Thursday 05/08 after class in the <strong>5th floor lobby</strong> to help with any remaining bugs you have in your final projects. Also, please <strong>post on Piazza</strong> for help instead of sending me email. (This actually has a better chance of getting a response from me, since my email is flooded.)</p>
